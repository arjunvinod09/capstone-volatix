Problem Statement 13: 

Stock Market Investment and Risk Management
Scenario: Investing in the stock market can be a daunting task for both novice and experienced 
investors. The market is highly volatile, with stock prices influenced by a myriad of factors, including 
economic indicators, company performance, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment. For 
example, a retail investor might struggle to keep up with the latest news, analyze complex financial 
data, and make informed decisions on when to buy or sell stocks. Furthermore, managing risk in a 
volatile market is challenging, especially when investors lack the tools to diversify their portfolios 
effectively or protect against sudden downturns. With so much information available, investors 
often feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to build a strategy that aligns with their financial goals 
and risk tolerance.
